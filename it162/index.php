                <p>Hello, and welcome on my portal for the IT 162 class!</p>
                <p>My name is Helene, which is pronounced Ellen (hence my domain's name, "ellencodes.com"!). The original spelling is because I am French. I have been an international student at Seattle Central College for a year now, and love learning how to code and create websites; I am planning on getting an AAS in Programming.</p>
                <p>When I am not studying, I love to hike and to travel. Traveling has been quite challenging in the last few months, so I am focusing on (safely) exploring the gorgeous state I am currently living in; Washington State.</p>
                <p>While I am still learning and improving my skills, especially in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I would love to expend my network and connection, so please feel free to contact me.</p>
