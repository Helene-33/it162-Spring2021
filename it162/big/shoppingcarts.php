    <p>In order for users to be able to order and pay for products on your website, you will need to use a shopping cart. There are a lot of different shopping cart softwares, such as Shopify, Ecwid and Shopaccino for instance, but if you do not wish to pay “for a ready-made solution” (Drake), then you can create one yourself.  The different shopping cart softwares have their range of pros and cons; the prices can be quite expensive, especially if you are just starting your business, and some aren’t available worldwide or require good coding skills. On the other hand, they are secured, and can offer package deals including the possibility to sell your products not only on your website, but also on social media with for example Facebook shop or Instagram store, and through other sites such as Amazon and eBay for instance.</p>
    <p>If you do not wish to use a shopping cart software but to make one yourself, you will then need “ecommerce web hosting to be able to cater for your shopping website, and ensure [that] you add a credit card processing option to make payment online” (Drake). If you already have experience with coding and working on websites, it isn’t that difficult. Some examples of ecommerce web hosting are A2 Hosting, Bluehost, and SiteGround. “A2 Hosting is the best all-round ecommerce provider” (Carney), but just as for shopping cart softwares, each ecommerce provider has pros and cons. For your website to accept credit card payments you can use “an online merchant gateway, [...] [set] up a POS system with a merchant account or [use] a mobile card reader to accept credit card payments through a smartphone app” (FreshBooks). PayPal and Stripe are the most famous online payment gateways, and their role is to process the users’ payments for you.</p>
    <p>Choosing the right option for you will therefore depend on your budget, the size of your business, your online presence, and your coding skills.</p>
