    <p>It is well known that “a picture is worth a thousand words”, and therefore pictures, illustrations, and visual design are an important part of a website. After all, “large blocks of text can often scare visitors off before they even read the content” (IONOS), and that’s why images are so important, “whether they’re used to illustrate a text, to create a personal or emotional bond with the user, or to visualize the details of a product” (IONOS). Galleries are used to apply images to a website, and therefore they are a great tool to utilize. Different software and scripts are available, and are offering a lot of options to personalize your gallery, such as for instance ZenPhoto and Jalbum.</p>
    <p>Another useful tool when working on your gallery is using jQuery sliders as they “offer a simple, elegant way to display content without giving up valuable real estate on your web page” (Ziegler). Sliders are coming in many different types, sizes, shapes, and price range (but some of them are still free). The standard photo slider is very popular, and consists of an image with a caption. More complex slider types include mixed contents, 3D sliders, and gallery style sliders. On mobile devices, sliders can be responding not only to the touch of the user, but also to being dragged and dropped.</p>
    <p>Many tutorials exist online to create a gallery, like for instance on the W3C web page “How to Create a Slideshow” where you can find the HTML code as well as the CSS and JavaScript codes used to create a slideshow gallery with arrows on the sides of the pictures in order to go from one to another, but also the number of pictures and a caption. Under the picture viewed by the user is the gallery of all the different pictures in the page.</p>
