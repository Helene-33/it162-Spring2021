    <p>Depending on your client’s business and needs, you might want to take the time to think which one between a responsive website or a mobile app is the most appropriate to create (if time and budget only allow you to focus on one). By comparing these two in this research, we will be able to understand better the pros and cons of each of them and make better decisions about when to use one instead of the other.</p>
    <p>Since the number of smartphone users keeps increasing (there are “more than 3.5 billion smartphone users in the world today” (Babich)), having a presence on mobile devices either with a responsive device or a mobile app is crucial for many businesses. However, even if there is “a clear indicator that a business should be present on mobile devices, it doesn’t mean that users will spend that much time in your app. Most of this 90% of mobile traffic belongs to famous apps like Facebook, Instagram, and banking applications” (Cherednichenko). Moreover, with over “four million [apps] on the App Store and Google Play Store combined” (Cherednichenko), having users download your app can be tricky: “acquiring users is more challenging for a mobile app than for websites” explains Cherednichenko: but she also mentions that “on the other hand, engagement is usually higher with a mobile app because of the value an app can bring”. In fact, by accessing mobile-specific features, an app offers to the users a more smooth and personalized experience with for instance notifications, cameras, and geolocation.</p>
    <p>Yet, a website with responsive design has also many advantages; the cost of production is lower than an app, the user doesn’t need to install anything on his device as all you need is access to an internet connection, and the website can be use not only on smartphones and tablets but also bigger devices such as desktops. Moreover, because there is no need “to go through approvals at the App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android” (Babich), it is easier to put online and to update your codes to make any changes in an instant. However, responsive websites are slower than apps.</p>
    <p>As I said earlier, both responsive websites and mobile apps offer a lot of pros and some cons. I think that responsive websites are a great start to gain online presence and visibility for your business; once this is established, we can evaluate if there is a need for a mobile app.</p>
